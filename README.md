<h1>Library</h1>

<p>Project Libraray is just another project of The Odin Project path I'm taking. It's pretty much simple. You create book informations that you've read and save it to myList where you change read statur or delete it as you wish like. You also have path to localStorage, so everytime you come back your last results stays as they are.</p>
